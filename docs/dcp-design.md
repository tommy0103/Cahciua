# Deterministic Context Pipeline

## Purpose

Cahciua does not treat an LLM transcript as authoritative application state. It stores platform events and Driver turn responses, then deterministically reconstructs model context through four ownership layers.

This design provides replayability, explicit side-effect boundaries, provider portability, and stable prompt prefixes for KV caching.

## Data Flow

```text
Telegram update
  -> Telegram adaptation
  -> CanonicalIMEvent
  -> Projection reducer
  -> IntermediateContext (IC)
  -> Rendering
  -> reusable unmasked base records
  -> Driver window/masking view
  -> RenderedContext segments (RC)

RC + Driver TurnResponses
  -> timestamp merge
  -> ConversationEntry[]
  -> request-local optimization
  -> provider wire codec
  -> non-streaming LLM request
```

Data moves forward. Projection does not read Driver state. Driver does not write synthetic assistant output into IC. Late-bound data is appended to the request as a synthetic user message.

## Adaptation

Canonical types live in `src/adaptation/types.ts`. Telegram's mapper lives in `src/telegram/adaptation.ts`; this keeps platform decoding next to Telegram while preserving canonical ownership outside the platform module.

Canonical IDs are strings. Every event carries:

- `receivedAtMs`: local ingress time captured before asynchronous transforms.
- `timestampSec`: Telegram server time.
- `utcOffsetMin`: ingress-local timezone offset.

`receivedAtMs` is the ordering timestamp. Persistence uses `(received_at, id)` as a deterministic tie-break.

Media descriptions are resolved before adaptation admits an event. Raw TDLib updates capture ingress metadata before any await; metadata resolution and media work happen in the ordered manager queue. The queue can transform later events in parallel but commits only the contiguous ready prefix. Transform or commit failures retry and block the session rather than publishing incomplete context.

## Projection

Projection is a pure Immer-backed reducer:

```text
reduce(IC, CanonicalIMEvent) -> IC'
```

Message content edits and deletes mutate their existing nodes. Entity metadata changes append system-event nodes. Message-ID deduplication preserves the synthetic `isSelfSent` marker while replacing synthetic content and attachments with the authoritative userbot echo.

Projection never performs I/O and never receives LLM output.

## Rendering

Rendering selects a caller-supplied output window from a consumer-owned IC and converts its nodes into ordered read-only base records, using its own public contract rather than exporting IC nodes. A record has a `kind` discriminator, explicit `metadata`, and `presentation.body`; message records also carry a preformatted blocked representation and activation facts. Message metadata includes chat/message identity, ingress/server timestamps, sender/reply/forward snapshots, edit/delete/self-send state and attachment descriptions. It contains neither the source content tree nor thumbnail bytes. Metadata is copied into independent frozen snapshots. Formatting remains common to all consumers.

Pipeline caches records per chat by immutable IC node identity, complete-source revision matching for equivalent replay nodes, and a value snapshot of display parameters (bot identity and contact names). IC nodes and revision strings stay private to the renderer. Unchanged records reuse body XML and Sharp handles. Edits, deletes, authoritative echoes, media description changes during replay, and display parameter changes refresh affected records. Each render replaces the cache with the selected node set; `retainWindow()` evicts entries outside a caller-supplied range without formatting. IC retains its existing projection lifetime, including reply snapshots. Cold replay continues to load only the active event window.

Online window advancement also filters Pipeline's stored base-record array without invoking rendering or publishing new input. This prevents the next event from generating a large deletion diff for already compacted messages; retained records and their XML/Sharp objects are reused. Driver keeps its independently held input snapshot until the next event. Pipeline's array filtering does not update that snapshot or enable earlier collection of records still referenced by Driver. Summary/model/budget changes belong entirely to downstream consumers.

`render(ic, params, window)` and `createRenderer().render(ic, params, window)` share window selection before XML/body/metadata/revision/image construction. `ic.sessionId` scopes the range to one chat. `fromReceivedAtMs` is inclusive and `untilReceivedAtMs` exclusive; omitted bounds are unbounded and equal bounds yield an empty output. All nodes sharing a timestamp are included or excluded together; this time range is not a stable pagination key. Rendering does not understand compaction or index progress.

Online Pipeline owns IC, renderer and rendering-window residency. Startup and the Driver adapter map `compaction.newCursorMs` to the lower bound; Driver compaction rejects non-resident chats, while startup can seed a range before replay. A historical consumer independently restores IC, holds its own renderer and requests bounded output windows through the same entry. Output range does not restrict the state needed to resolve replies or apply later edits/deletes. A consumer must restore those dependencies and revisit affected older output ranges. Rendering never treats an arbitrary event batch as complete state.

User-controlled identity is encoded in XML attributes. Content is escaped and cannot inject sibling message attributes. Attachments expose stable logical file IDs in `messageId:index` form; TDLib-local IDs are not persisted.

Driver owns the model segment contract in `context-types.ts`. Its pure `selectContextView()` converts base records to that distinct shape: select records at or after the chat cursor, choose a message's normal or blocked XML, suppress blocked images and activation flags, and retain scheduling identity. It explicitly copies model fields; record metadata is never spread into model segments. Base records cannot be passed directly to model consumers or used as model context types. Source events remain in persistence and IC; other consumers can use the explicit unmasked record contract without learning Projection internals. Historical `read_old_messages` uses the same conversion without the live cursor.

See [Rendering interfaces](rendering-interfaces.md) for contract examples, ownership and lifetime rules.

## Historical Input

`src/history/build-input.ts` is an independent archival consumer of Projection and Rendering, with its own IC, cache and output range. `src/db/history-archive.ts` captures per-chat/per-source ID fences and keyset-pages events, TR and compactions. History emits keyed saved-item upserts with stable archive references and original timeline positions. Rendering provides a full, image-free host-internal transcript separately from runtime previews/tombstones; explicit reply quotes now persist in events.

`buildHistorySlice` materializes those same saved items into a separate history.db using per-target structured Projection state. It restores only the current event's declared message/user/chat dependencies, applies the shared pure reducer and renders touched nodes. Saved items, relations, full FTS text, dependency state, task identities/notices and source checkpoints commit in one history transaction. Row-ID fences and `(time,id)` keysets belong to generation/chat/source; a restart restores the next row's dependencies without replaying committed prefixes. Version/display/source identities reject incompatible resumes. Single-row decoding/rendering, byte/entry/output budgets and throttled slices bound the bootstrap workspace, while persisted history remains on disk.

`src/history/cli.ts` is an independent offline/bootstrap process with a read-only archive connection and short indexed snapshots. It has no bot startup await. The older origin-replaying `buildHistoryInput` remains an in-memory reference consumer. All summaries and readable IR tools/results survive independently of online compaction/masking/token transforms. Captured fences do not freeze mutable rows/cache values: no live mutation log, reconciliation, baselineComplete or query service is implemented. See [Historical archive input](history-input.md) for operational limits and fixture verification.

## Driver Context

Turn responses persist provider-independent `ConversationEntry[]` plus:

```text
requestedAtMs
modelName
inputTokens
outputTokens
cacheReadTokens
cacheWriteTokens
```

RC and turn responses are sorted independently and merged by timestamp. RC precedes TR at equal timestamps, which preserves causality and satisfies Anthropic role alternation.

`composeContext()` performs deterministic history optimization:

- remove old pure-text assistant turns beyond the newest five;
- remove RC copies of `isSelfSent` messages represented by send tool calls;
- lower old tool-result image detail and trim old oversized tool-result text;
- sanitize reasoning when stored model identity is incompatible;
- sanitize provider-sensitive tool IDs at the wire boundary;
- prepend the latest compaction summary.

The existing summary does not contribute to the raw compaction trigger estimate.

## Provider Boundary

`src/llm/call.ts` accepts `ConversationEntry[]` and dispatches to one of three non-streaming transports:

- `src/llm/chat.ts`
- `src/llm/messages.ts`
- `src/llm/responses.ts`

`src/unified-api/` converts between IR and wire objects. Provider-specific reasoning/signature data remains attached to IR output nodes. Request-local image limiting happens before every codec invocation, including probes, fallback turns, compaction, and media/tool-generated images.

Usage is normalized at this boundary. OpenAI input totals already include cache hits. Anthropic reports uncached input separately, so cache reads and writes are added to produce total `inputTokens`.

Request and response JSON is written to `/tmp/cahciua/<id>.*.json` for debugging.

## Wake-Up Scheduling

Each configured chat owns a scheduler controller built on alien-signals.

The scheduler computes reply eligibility from:

- unprocessed external RC segments;
- continuation of an interrupted tool loop;
- the last failed RC identity;
- current running state.

Debounce is sender-aware. The message that opens a window identifies the trigger sender; only later messages from that sender move the message deadline. Typing from any observed user moves the typing deadline. `maxDelayMs` is a hard cap from window creation.

Calls are serialized. New input does not preempt a model call, tool side effect, or persistence. The turn loop checks interruption only after the completed step has been persisted, then exits cooperatively. The reactive scheduler creates a new wake-up with current RC.

## Probe And Primary

A wake-up normally has two phases:

1. **Probe** is an outside judge. It receives one forced tool, `decide`.
2. **Primary** runs only when `should_act` is `send_message`.

`should_act=no_action`, missing calls, invalid JSON, invalid enum values, and missing reasons all fail closed. Probe responses are persisted separately and advance the processed watermark, but never enter primary context.

The only probe bypass is continuation of a persisted interrupted tool loop. Mentions, direct replies, and runtime events still use probe.

Primary may execute multiple tools over multiple steps. `send_message.still_working=true` marks a send whose wake-up still requires another step. Other tool results also carry `requiresFollowUp`.

An activated wake-up must contain a successful `send_message`. If a clean `end_turn` closes the current interruption chain without any send, Driver runs one additional step with named `send_message` tool choice. The fallback uses the same prompt and starting context.

## Runner And Turn Loop

Runner has two operations:

```text
callModelStep(entries) -> model entries + usage
executeToolStep(model entries) -> model entries + tool results
```

Providers may ignore forced tool choice. Runner retries up to three times after the first attempt, accumulates usage from rejected attempts, and executes only the selected/final output.

The shared turn loop then:

1. calls the model;
2. executes tool calls sequentially;
3. persists the completed step;
4. terminates if no tool requires follow-up;
5. checks external interruption;
6. appends the step to working entries and continues.

No AbortController is used for chat interruption. Provider request timeouts remain local to the provider transports.

## Compaction

Compaction is an independent per-chat controller parallel to reply scheduling.

- High water mark: `maxContextEstTokens` over raw RC + TR content after the cursor.
- Low water mark: `workingWindowEstTokens`, used to choose the new cursor.

The selected old window is summarized into structured plain text. A new row is appended to `compactions`, then compaction metadata advances the pure Driver view and releases obsolete Pipeline rendering records. The cursor effect performs no rendering and never writes the base input signal. Compaction is not a turn response and never deletes historical events or TR rows.

## Telegram Runtime

Telegram uses two possible TDLib clients:

- Bot: required, owns all outbound actions.
- Userbot: optional, exclusively owns ingress when configured.

The manager owns raw clients, ordered ingress, and blocking transforms. Live handlers preserve side-effect order:

```text
persist platform message/edit/delete row
-> persist canonical event
-> if configured: hydrate cached alt text
-> project/render base records
-> apply model-view policy
-> notify DriverInputBus
```

The queue retries the same commit object on persistence/publication failure; live handlers and the event sink make each phase idempotent. Unconfigured chats stop after persistence.

Driver hooks own outbound sends. After Telegram confirms a send (the terminal `updateMessageSendSucceeded`/`updateMessageSendFailed` that also carries the final server message id), they create and persist a synthetic `isSelfSent` event, project it for configured chats, and deliberately do not notify Driver. This makes the bot's action visible to the next probe before userbot echo, and its message id makes the echo deduplication in Projection an exact match.

Spam moderation is a bot-owned side effect enabled per chat through `tools.banSpammer` (default false). Tool exposure and backend authorization share the enabled-chat setting. Group policy is injected into probe and primary through chat `systemFiles`. Deployment-local group policies can identify eligible accounts through sufficient conversational history showing exclusively one-off solicitation. Genuine questions, feedback, and ordinary exchanges establish normal participation. For normal members discussing topics outside the bot's permitted scope, the bot remains silent on that topic and leaves member conduct to human administrators. Archived names and messages serve as internal reference examples interpreted in context. Targets are derived from persisted evidence messages and limited to eligible members with fewer than 10 distinct archived message IDs. Counting retains deleted messages and deduplicates edits, with scope limited to observed history.

The existing tool call/result history records the evidence ID, private reason, target UID, and actual moderation outcomes. Each invocation checks current membership and evidence, counts observed messages from the existing archive, permanently bans, and deletes the known messages Telegram permits within 48 hours. Repeated calls inspect current state; messages already unavailable to the bot are reported separately from successful deletions. Canonical delete events reconcile confirmed removals with Driver notification disabled. After a confirmed ban, primary sends the supplied anonymous UID-link announcement as the sole `text` argument to `send_message`. Private assessment data stays in the tool history. Partial cleanup receives its own factual announcement, preserving the probe gate and mandatory-send invariant.

Post-startup tasks backfill missing animation hashes and uncached custom emoji, then replay affected resident chats.

## Media Runtime

Media processing is platform-neutral and lives in `src/media/`. The runtime builds resolver maps from each resolved chat config, so model, concurrency, and frame overrides apply per chat while content-addressed cache rows remain shared.

Image descriptions use deterministic thumbnail hashes. Animation descriptions use file hashes and equidistant frame selection. Static/animated custom emoji use `emoji:<customEmojiId>` cache keys. All descriptions share `image_alt_texts`.

Cached alt text is applied transiently during replay/live publication. It is never added to persisted canonical event JSON.

## Composition And Lifecycle

`src/container/` is the composition root. Typed symbol tokens are registered through a static registrar list and cached per child container. Registrars are grouped by core configuration, persistence, Telegram clients/manager, media, Pipeline, and Driver/event adapters.

No business factory receives the container. No registrar is discovered from the filesystem. This keeps the dependency graph visible and compatible with the single-entry tsdown bundle.

`DriverInputBus` breaks event-producer/Driver construction cycles. It buffers only the newest base rendering per chat while attached but inactive. Typing is ephemeral and is ignored before activation.

Startup and shutdown order is documented in `AGENTS.md` and implemented by `src/startup/index.ts`.

## Determinism Boundary

Determinism applies to adaptation, projection, rendering, merge, and request composition for the same stored inputs and parameters. Network responses, local ingress timestamps, scheduling time, tool side effects, and LLM generation are explicitly outside that pure boundary. Their results are persisted before they influence subsequent reconstruction.
